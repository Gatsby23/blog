this is the way you left me
i’m not pretending
no hope, no love, no glory
no happy ending

wake up in the morning
stumble on my life
can’t get no love without sacrifice
if anything should happen
i guess i wish you well
a little bit of heaven
but a little bit of hell

this is the hardest story
that i’ve ever told
no hope, or love, or glory
happy endings gone forever more
i feel as if i’m wasting
and i’m wasting everyday

this is the way you left me
i’m not pretending
no hope, no love, no glory
no happy ending
this is the way that we love
like it’s forever
then live the rest of our life
but not together

2 o’clock in the morning
something’s on my mind
can’t get no rest
keep walking around
if i pretend that nothing ever went wrong
i can get to my sleep
i can think that we just carried on

this is the hardest story
that i’ve ever told
no hope, or love, or glory
happy endings gone forever more
i feel as if i’m wasting
and i’m wasting everyday

this is the way you left me
i’m not pretending
no hope, no love, no glory
no happy ending
this is the way that we love
like it’s forever
then live the rest of our life
but not together

a little bit of love
little bit of love
little bit of love
little bit of love
little bit of love…
i feel as if i’m wasting (little bit of love)

this is the way you left me
i’m not pretending
no hope, no love, no glory
no happy ending
this is the way that we love
like it’s forever
then live the rest of our life
but not together

this is the way you left me
i’m not pretending
no hope, no love, no glory
no happy ending
