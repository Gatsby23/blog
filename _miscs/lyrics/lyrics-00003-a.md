(hey, what's the big idea?)

suckin' too hard on your lollipop
oh love's gonna get you down
suckin' too hard on your lollipop
oh love's gonna get you down
say love, say love
oh love's gonna get you down
say love, say love
oh love's gonna get you down

i went walking with my mama one day
when she warned me what people say
"live your life until love is found
cuz love's gonna get you down"

"take a look at the girl next door
she's a player and a downlight bore
jesus loves her but she wants more
oh bad girls get you down"

suckin' too hard on your lollipop
oh love's gonna get you down
suckin' too hard on your lollipop
oh love's gonna get you down
say love, say love
oh love's gonna get you down
say love, say love
oh love's gonna get you down

mama told me what i should know
too much candy's gonna rot your soul
if she loves you, let her go!
cuz love only gets you down

now take a look at the boy like me
never stood on my own two feet
now i'm blue, as i can be
oh love, come and get me down!

suckin' too hard on your lollipop
oh love's gonna get you down
suckin' too hard on your lollipop
oh love's gonna get you down
say love, say love
oh love's gonna get you down
say love, say love
oh love's gonna get you down

(i went walking with my mama one day,
when she warned me what people say
"live your life until love is found,
or love's gonna get you down")

suckin' too hard on your lollipop
oh love's gonna get you down
suckin' too hard on your lollipop
oh love's gonna get you down
say love, say love
oh love's gonna get you down
say love, say love
oh love's gonna get you down

mama told me what i should know
too much candyâ€˜s gonna rot your soul
if she loves you, let her go!
cuz love only gets you down

whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, lollipop
