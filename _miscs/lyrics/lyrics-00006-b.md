is this the way you left me
im not pretending
no hope no love no glory
no happy ending

pick up in the morning
stumble on my life
can get no love witout sacrifies

if anything should happend,
i guess i wish you there
but a little bit of haven
a little bit of hell

this is the hardest story that i ever told
no hope no love no glory
happy hending gone forever more

i think different where you stand
and i where you stare everyday

is this the way you left me
im not pretending
no hope no love no glory
no happy ending

is this the way that we love
that catch forever
but then live the rest of my life
but not together

is this the way you left me
im not pretending
no hope no love no glory
no happy ending

this the way that we love
that catche forever

then live the rest of our live
but not together

two o'clock in the morning
something's on my mind
can't get more risk
keep walking around

if i pretend that nothing ever went wrong
i can get back to my sleep that backen things that scare it on

this is the hardest story that i ever told
no hope no love no glory happy hending
gone forever more

i feel a different way where you stand
and i where you stand everyady

a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love
a little bit love

things are different ways
this is the way you left me
i'm not pretending
the rest of my life

is this the way you left me,
im not pretending
no hope no love no glory
no happy ending

then live the rest of our live
but not together

no happy ending
