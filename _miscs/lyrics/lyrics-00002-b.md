Let's dance inside
let's dance for a while
haven't cant wait where Rany watching the skies
happy for the best pitty expecting the worse
are you gonna drop the bomb or not,

let us die young, let us live forever.
we dont have the power but we never say never
sitting in the sand pit, life is short trip,
and music is for the sad man

can you image when the race is won
tenickle to face into the song,
phraising our leaders we are getting into the music
played by the mad man

forever young
I want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever, and ever

forever young,
I want to be forever young,
do you really want to live forever
forever young

someone like baud someone like the heat,
some other melody some other bead.
sooner or later, that you'll be gone.
Why dont't stay young?
It's so hard to get all without a cost.
I don't want to perrish like a fadding horse.
you split diamonds in the sun.
and diamonds that forever.

so many effects that could happen today.
so many songs that you forgot to play.
so many dreams spinning out of blue
let them come true

forever young
I want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever, and ever

forever young
I want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever, and ever

forever young,
I want to be forever young,
do you really want to be forever
forever young,
I want to be forever young,
do you really want to live forever
forever, and ever

forever young,
I want to be forever young,
do you really want to be forever

forever young
I want to be forever young
do you really want to live forever
forever young
