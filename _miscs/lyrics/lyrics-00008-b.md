you are so sweet
dancing to the best
there is a landmark down the street
the boys and girls watching each other
you are so sweet so sweet
dancing and moving to their beat
there is a landmark down the street
the boys and girls is watching each other

sleep sleep
they want to watch
to watch each other sleep
for all
to watch each other
you are so sweet
what's more
you are so sweet
so long
i were walking through the city
like an drunk bunard

and now
the cars don't stare
and isn't speed
touched all the time

a soly a matter a what
there is a landmark down the street
the boys and girls watch each other
sleeping

there is a meet mark down the street
watching
they went to watch to watch each other sleep
