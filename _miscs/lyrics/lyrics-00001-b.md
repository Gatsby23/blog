(this is a Demo)
From the moment you walked into my life, 
Everything felt
From the moment I looked into your eyes, 
I knew I had to make you mine. 
Girl you had me hooked on your love but it was all a game to you. 
You drove a stake right through to my heart, 
and left me bleeding for your love. 
I tried everything to prove I loved you, 
Gave my all to make all of ur dreams come true. 
But I'm no longer blinded by your lies, 
Why am I the solo player (in this game for two) 
I'm the solo player (my love was never true) 
I can be the solo player 
I saw the look at your smile and it makes me feel, 
Everything will be all right 
It's like I'm still in love with you, 
Or maybe I'm just a fool. 
Girl you had me hooked on your love but it was all a game to you. 
Oh you drove a stake right through to my heart, 
But I will bleed for you no more. 
I tried everything to prove I the buster loved you, 
Gave your dreams come true. 
But I'm not longer blinded by your lies, 
I know your heart was never mine. 
Why am I the solo player (in this game for two)

I tried everything to prove I loved you,
