i have a tale
but not a tale
a fearless to come

i saw the girl
a real girl
i'm calling my real name

and this begin
at summer camp
she saw a boy
who would soon be a teenage bun

nina and her very long hair
how that torce got no where
she play with that sunnable smile
everything she has through
every tries she shoe

nina and her very long hair
how that torce got no where
as hard as she tried
he never look twice
he never did see the light and then apply
of nina

sometimes a film
comes over to me
like a cold cup of tea

and i forget where i was sit
a snail gravincies
like seventeen
she  still live in
she went to camp
and the come and the camp
and the same mofin

nina and her very long hair
how that torce got no where
she play with that sunnable smile
everything she has through
every tries she never shoe

nina and her very long hair
how that torce got no where
as hard as she tried
he never look twice
he never did see the light and then apply
nina

and so she slept
she color and she clipped
close and she clean
how is that make a spoon

she was a girl
very short hand
not to know where
