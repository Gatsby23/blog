i walked across an emplty land,
i know the puff, we like the back of my hand

our filty yard, beneath my feet
sat by the river, and it did make me complete

oh sympathy, where have you gone?
i'm getting older and i need somethig to rely on
so tell me when you gonna let me in
i'm getting tired at night in somewhere to begin

i came across i fall on tree,
i felt the branches that are look at me
is this the place we used to love
is this the place i've been dreamin on

oh sympathy, where have you gone?
i'm getting older and i need somethig to rely on
so tell me when you gonna let me in
i'm getting tired at night in somewhere to begin

walk somewhere only we go,
talk about something only we know.
this can be the end of everything.
somewhere only we go,
somewhere only we know

oh sympathy, where have you gone?
i'm getting older and i need somethig to rely on
so tell me when you gonna let me in
i'm getting tired at night in somewhere to begin

this can be the end of everything
somewhere only we go,
somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know
somewhere only we know
