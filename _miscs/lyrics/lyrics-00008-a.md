you are so sweet
dancing to that beat

there's a meat market down the street
the boys and the girls watch each other eat

you are so sweet, so sweet
dancing and moving to that beat, that beat

there's a meat market down the street
the boys and girls watch each other eat
the boys and the girls watch each other eat
when they really just wanna watch each other
sleep
they want to watch, to watch each other
sleep, sleep sleep
sleep
they want to watch, to watch each other
sleep, sleep, sleep

you are so sweet
you are so sweet

(her solo)

i'm walking through the city
like a drunk, but not
with my slip showing a little
like a drunk, but not
and i am one of your people
but the cars don't stop
and i am one of your people
but the cars don't stop
and it's been a long time since before i've been touched
now i'm getting touched all the time
and it's only a matter of whom
and it's only a matter of when

an addiction to hands and feet-
there's a meat market down the street
the boys and girls watch each other eat
when they really just wanna watch each other sleep
there's a meat market down the street
the boys and girls watch each other eat
when they really just wanna watch each other

sleep
they want to watch, to watch each other
sleep, sleep, sleep
sleep
they want to watch, to watch each other
sleep, sleep, sleep
sleep

they want to watch, to watch each other
they want to be watched, they want to be washed
they want to be touched, to touch each other
they want to sleep, they want to be slept
they want to watch, to watch each other
they want to be watched, they want to be washed
they want to be touched, to touch each other
they want to sleep, they want to be slept
they want to watch, to watch each other
they want to be watched, they want to be washed
they want to be touched, to touch each other
they want to sleep, they want to be slept
they want to watch, to watch each other
they want to watch, they want to be watched
to watch each other, to watch each other

watch each other
watch each other
watch each other
watch each other
watch each other...
