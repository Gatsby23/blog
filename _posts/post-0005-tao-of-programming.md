Book One: The Silent Void
-------------------------

> When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave.

<div style="font-size:128px;color:blueviolet;text-align:center">Tao</div>

* yin
* yang
* space
* time

* the master programmer
* the wise programmer
* the average programmer
* the foolish programmer

* follows the *`tao`*
* The Tao is hidden beyond all understanding

Book Two: The Ancient Masters
-----------------------------

> After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless.

Turing:

> I don't know whether I am Turing dreaming that I am a machine, or a machine dreaming that I am Turing!

* They come and go without knowing limitations.
* They are alive within the Tao.
* He has gone beyond the need for testing; each of his programs are perfect withn themselves, serene and elegant, their purpose self-evident. 
    + Truly, he has entered the mystery of Tao.

Book Three Design
-----------------

> When the program is being tested, it is too late to make design changes.

* Sir Thief
* "I am stealing ideas"

A master programmer to a novice programmer:

> What is appropriate for the master is not appropriate for the novice. You must understand Tao before transcending structure.

* When designing an operating system, the programmer seeks the simplest harmony between machine and ideas. This is why an operating system is easier to design." 
* "That is all good and well," he said, "but which is easier to debug?"
* 5 programmers, 10 programmers, 100 programmers...


Book Four: Coding
-----------------

> A well-written program is its own heaven; a poorly-written program its own hell.

<div style="color:blueviolet;font-size:128">Law of Least Astonishment</div>

* Computers simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect.
* The rules of programming are transitory; only Tao is eternal. Therefore you must contemplate Tao before you receive enlightenment.
* "Technique?" said the programmer turning from his terminal, "What I follow is Tao — beyond all techniques!

Book Five: Maintenance
----------------------

> Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to be maintained. 

* A well-used door needs no oil on its hinges.
* A swift-flowing stream does not grow stagnant.
* Neither sound nor thoughts can travel through a vacuum.
* Software rots if not used.
* These are great mysteries.

Book Six: Management
--------------------

> Let the programmers be many and the managers few — then all will be productive. 

* Why are the programmers resigning one by one?
* Because they are burnt out.

So the manager said: "All right, in that case you may set your own working hours, as long as you finish your projects on schedule." The programmers, now satisfied, began to come in at noon and work until the wee hours of the morning.

Book Seven: Corporate Wisdom
----------------------------

> You can demonstrate a program for an executive, but you can't make him computer literate.

The novice programmer stares in wonder at the bird, for he understands it not. The average programmer dreads the coming of the bird, for he fears its message. The master programmer continues to work at his terminal, for he does not know that the bird has come and gone. 


Book Eight: Hardware and Software
---------------------------------

> Without the wind, the grass does not move. Without software, hardware is useless.

By not seeking to strive, it conquers without effort.

* Computer game: Easy, Medium, Hard
* Another level: The master dropped the device to the ground and crushed it underfoot.


Book Nine: Epilogue
-------------------

> Time for you to leave.
