**Arya Stark** <img src="http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/Arya,_Ned_and_Syrio_1x03.jpg?imageView2/2/w/150" align="right">

When her father is betrayed and executed by Joffrey, Arya flees the capital
with the help of the Night's Watch recruiter, Yoren, who gets her out of the
city disguised as an orphan boy "Arry" and tries to take her to Winterfell. On
the way, she compiles a list of people she intends to kill. However, she is
taken prisoner by Ser Gregor Clegane's men and taken to Harrenhal, where she
briefly serves as cupbearer to an unsuspecting Tywin Lannister. After escaping,
she begins making her way towards Riverrun and is captured by the Brotherhood
Without Banners and subsequently by Sandor Clegane. They travel across Westeros
as he unsuccessfully attempts to ransom her to various family members. In
Clegane's company, Arya becomes increasingly hardened and brutalized, and
personally kills a number of men. After Clegane is gravely injured in a fight,
she abandons him. Long presumed dead by many in Westeros and with nowhere else
to turn, Arya is now in Braavos, training with the Faceless Men. However, as a
consequence of violating the assassins' code, Arya has been rendered blind by
the guild as punishment.

**Daenerys Targaryen** <img src="http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/Daenerys-MothersMercy.jpg?imageView2/2/w/150" align="right">

She hatched three dragons by having her petrified dragon eggs placed on Drogo's
funeral pyre, before she walked into the flames to claim them. Her dragons are
the first seen in the world for more than a century, earning her the sobriquet
Mother of Dragons.

During her campaign in Slaver's Bay, she is introduced as Daenerys Stormborn of
the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen,
Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great
Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons. She has proven herself as
a leader and a conqueror through her swift and (for the most part) merciful
conquests of the Free Slaveholding Cities of Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen.

The Dothraki are a race of nomadic horse-mounted warriors in Essos, the
continent to the east of Westeros across the Narrow Sea. They inhabit the vast
central plains of Essos, known as the Dothraki sea. They are said to be born,
fight, and die in the saddle.

Essos is an immense landmass located to the east of Westeros, extending into
the far east of the known world. The Free Cities are located on its
north-western shores, with the Dothraki sea located deep in the continental
interior and the cities of Slaver's Bay on the south coast. The continent
extends far to the east, around the Jade Sea, to the distant and fabled lands
of Asshai and the Shadow. Essos climate is temperate in the northern and
western portions, and subtropical in the southern & eastern portions. Rainfall
generally decreases as one moves eastward in Essos.

The extreme eastern end of the continent has not been fully mapped. Westeros's
landmass is much longer from north to south, extending from the deserts of
Dorne to the polar regions north of the Wall, but east-to-west travel is much
shorter. In contrast, the greater bulk of Essos runs along an east-west
latitude, while its northern and southern extremes are a shorter distance. On
the western shore of Essos, the furthest point north at Braavos is at the same
latitude as the Vale of Arryn, and the furthest point south near Tyrosh is at
the same latitude as Dorne, separated only by the island chain known as the
Stepstones. Pentos, located roughly between these two extremes, is at the same
latitude as King's Landing.

Westeros is a continent located in the far west of the known world. It is
separated from the continent of Essos by a strip of water known as the Narrow
Sea. Most of the action in Game of Thrones takes place in Westeros.

Westeros is a continent located in the far west of the known world. It is
separated from the continent of Essos by a strip of water known as the Narrow

Author of the series George R.R. Martin has stated that the continent of
Westeros is roughly the same size as the real-life continent of South America.

Almost the entire continent, barring only the lands in the furthest north
beyond the Wall, is ruled by a single political entity known as the Seven
Kingdoms, which holds fealty to the King of the Andals and the First Men, who
sits on the Iron Throne in the city of King's Landing. The terms "Seven
Kingdoms" and "Westeros" are normally used interchangeably.

People or things from Westeros are referred to as "Westerosi".
