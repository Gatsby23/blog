**Arya Stark** <img src="http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/Arya,_Ned_and_Syrio_1x03.jpg?imageView2/2/w/150" align="right">

When her father is betrayed and executed by Joffrey, Arya flees the capital
with the help of the Night's Watch recruiter, Yoren, who gets her out of the
city disguised as an orphan boy "Arry" and tries to take her to Winterfell. On
the way, she compiles a list of people she intends to kill. However, she is
taken prisoner by Ser Gregor Clegane's men and taken to Harrenhal, where she
briefly serves as cupbearer to an unsuspecting Tywin Lannister. After escaping,
she begins making her way towards Riverrun and is captured by the Brotherhood
Without Banners and subsequently by Sandor Clegane. They travel across Westeros
as he unsuccessfully attempts to ransom her to various family members. In
Clegane's company, Arya becomes increasingly hardened and brutalized, and
personally kills a number of men. After Clegane is gravely injured in a fight,
she abandons him. Long presumed dead by many in Westeros and with nowhere else
to turn, Arya is now in Braavos, training with the Faceless Men. However, as a
consequence of violating the assassins' code, Arya has been rendered blind by
the guild as punishment.

**Daenerys Targaryen** <img src="http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/Daenerys-MothersMercy.jpg?imageView2/2/w/150" align="right">

She hatched three dragons by having her petrified dragon eggs placed on Drogo's
funeral pyre, before she walked into the flames to claim them. Her dragons are
the first seen in the world for more than a century, earning her the sobriquet
Mother of Dragons.

During her campaign in Slaver's Bay, she is introduced as Daenerys Stormborn of
the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen,
Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great
Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons. She has proven herself as
a leader and a conqueror through her swift and (for the most part) merciful
conquests of the Free Slaveholding Cities of Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen.
