**Arya Stark** <img src="http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/Arya,_Ned_and_Syrio_1x03.jpg?imageView2/2/w/150" align="right">

When her father is betrayed and executed by Joffrey, Arya flees the capital
with the help of the Night's Watch recruiter, Yoren, who gets her out of the
city disguised as an orphan boy "Arry" and tries to take her to Winterfell. On
the way, she compiles a list of people she intends to kill. However, she is
taken prisoner by Ser Gregor Clegane's men and taken to Harrenhal, where she
briefly serves as cupbearer to an unsuspecting Tywin Lannister. After escaping,
she begins making her way towards Riverrun and is captured by the Brotherhood
Without Banners and subsequently by Sandor Clegane. They travel across Westeros
as he unsuccessfully attempts to ransom her to various family members. In
Clegane's company, Arya becomes increasingly hardened and brutalized, and
personally kills a number of men. After Clegane is gravely injured in a fight,
she abandons him. Long presumed dead by many in Westeros and with nowhere else
to turn, Arya is now in Braavos, training with the Faceless Men. However, as a
consequence of violating the assassins' code, Arya has been rendered blind by
the guild as punishment.

**Daenerys Targaryen** <img src="http://whudoc.qiniudn.com/Daenerys-MothersMercy.jpg?imageView2/2/w/150" align="right">

She hatched three dragons by having her petrified dragon eggs placed on Drogo's
funeral pyre, before she walked into the flames to claim them. Her dragons are
the first seen in the world for more than a century, earning her the sobriquet
Mother of Dragons.

During her campaign in Slaver's Bay, she is introduced as Daenerys Stormborn of
the House Targaryen, the First of Her Name, the Unburnt, Queen of Meereen,
Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great
Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons. She has proven herself as
a leader and a conqueror through her swift and (for the most part) merciful
conquests of the Free Slaveholding Cities of Astapor, Yunkai and Meereen.

EP.4 `@`{.tzx-anchor #ep-4}

<small>这是讲稿，课上漏了一点，但基本一致。这是我之前的录音：<http://www.ximalaya.com/39833779/album/3827746></small>

Game of Thrones is an American tv series adapted from George Martin's A Song of
Ice and Fire. This tv show is so much a fantasy and so great that it attracted
a big audience.  I've watched 4 seasons of it, and really like it and willing
to share some of my opinions on it. The focus today is Eddard Stark, popularly
known as Ned, is a major character in the first season. But before that, I'll
introduce the backgrounds and settings of this story.

This is the world map for game of throne. As you can see, the world is
separated to two parts by the narrow sea. The west is called Westeros, while
the right part is called Essos. Westeros and essos are the known world, while
the land beyond castle black, is unknown. Westeros is ruled by a single
political entity known as the Seven Kingdoms. Ands here is the king's landing,
where the king lives. And in the north, Winterfell, is where Ned Stark is from.
As for Essos, there lived some kind of horse people, I mean, the Dothraki. And
Daenerys Targaryen gets her power there. The story of Ned mainly happended in
Winterfell and King's landing.

And these, are houses of Game of Throne. House Stark, Ned Stark. House
Lannister, she is the Queen. And House Baratheon, the King. House Targaryen.
You should know that the Mad King is a targaryen.

Now is time for Ned Stark. I'll share three scenes from Season 1 about Ned
Stark, and analyze the characteristics of Ned Stark, tell you guys why I like
this character. And after that, I'll compare him to three other characters to
illustrate why he is destined to fail and die.

Scene one, in the frontier of Winterfell, close to Castle Black, the northest
part of Westeros. Ned Stark sentenced the man to die. This man is a guardsman
in the night's watch and a deserter. His comrades were killed by white walkers
(the walking dead). Ned did his duty and executed the man. I think Ned in his
heart is a merciful man, but as the lord of Winterfell, law is law. He has no
choice but to commit his duty. Furthermore, he asked his son (here, this boy)
to watch the execution. He wants his son to be a calm and straight man as he
is.

Scene two, it's the small council of the king. And this time, they are arguing
about how to deal with Daenerys Targaryen, who is pregnant now. And may cross
the narrow sea, come back to claim her lands and power. Robert, the king,
insists sending a man to assassinating the girl, but Ned Stark disagree. King
Robert is kind of pissed off, saying towards the other four: you are my
council, counsel! So the other four people start telling Ned why they should
kill Daenerys at this time.

First is the Master of Whisperers, Varys, sometimes called "the Spider", says
the country must sometimes do vile, terrible, unfair, injustice things for the
good of the realm.

Then Grand Maester Pycelle, the old man over there, says if she leads a
Dothraki army coming for us, more people will die. For us, assassinating
Daenerys is not just wiser, but also kinder. This can save more people from
dying in the possible war in the future.

Lord Renly, Master of Laws, says "we should have them both killed years ago!"

Last, Master of Laws, Petyr Baelish, known as the little finger, thinks it's
not a big thing. Just get it over with and be done with it. Why not just kill
this girl?

No matter how, Ned resuses take any part in. Finally, he quited his job as the
Hand of the King, and went away.

He is an honorable man, too good for this kind of vile thing. His discipline
makes him too straight to bend.

Scene three. In the dungeon. Ned is arrested for treason, which of course is a
made-up sentence. He has a conversation with Varys, the Spider. Varys wants Ned
to confess his treason and kneel to the Queen. Ned? No!

> You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King, who butchered my men,
> who crippled my son?

And he will never proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Here you can see the
conficts.  Ned is too straight as a man, who will not yield to anything. Varys
is more flexible and claims to serve the realm.

Ned never take his life as some precious thing, and would not trade his honor
for a few more years life. If you've seen some Spartacus-like films, you'll
understand what these warriors, fighters, Gladiators treasure is -- glorious.

Then Ned continus,

> You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learned it well.
>
> But I grew up with soldiers, I learned how to die a long time ago.

And finally he died.

I really like this man and his personality. But in my opinion, his death is not
glorious or honorable at all. He died in a tragedy, died a terrible way. I
would compare this straight man to three other characters. First is Clyde
Shelton from The Law Abiding Citizen, second is David Gale from The Life of
David Gale, third is Javert from the famous Les Miserable. Like Ned, they are
all straight and disciplined man. But they have different endings.

Law Abiding Citizen tells a story of revenge. Two criminals broken into Clyde
Shelton's house, killed his daughter, raped his wife, in front of him. Because
the lawyer made a deal with the criminals, the criminals did not receive the
deserved punishments. So Clyde, used to be a law abiding citizen, decided to
punish the two criminals in his own way. And beyond that, he wants to destroy
the justice system. Finally he killed a series of people in the justice system
and failed, and died.  Comparing to Clyde Shelton, Ned Stark did not fight
back. Or maybe it's just he has no chance or possibility to do that.

The Life of David Gale. Gale is a professor and advocate to abanden the death
penalty. But He and his coworkers can't persuade the mayer. So he faked a
murderer so he would mistakenly be sentenced to death. After his death, his
coworkers revealed the story. In this way, he claimed his political appeal.
Comparing to David Gale, Ned Stark is not smart enough to play this kind of
trick to gather supports from other people.

(The dream cast in concert.)

Les Miserable, originally by Victor Hugo, is a famous musical. It has a
character called Javert, who is a straight man too, when he realize that Jean
Valjean is not real bad person. He was confused, struggling for a "WHY".
Finally, He jumped the river. Comparing the Jevart, Ned's death is not noble,
he was executed (decapitated) in public, for treason.  What a hilarious and
pathetic death.

But don't get me wrong, I really like this character, like this straight man,
like his discipline. I just feel bad when he did nothing when approaching
death. No fight, no glory.  And not honorable.

**Notes**

The Dothraki are a race of nomadic horse-mounted warriors in Essos, the
continent to the east of Westeros across the Narrow Sea. They inhabit the vast
central plains of Essos, known as the Dothraki sea. They are said to be born,
fight, and die in the saddle.

Essos is an immense landmass located to the east of Westeros, extending into
the far east of the known world. The Free Cities are located on its
north-western shores, with the Dothraki sea located deep in the continental
interior and the cities of Slaver's Bay on the south coast. The continent
extends far to the east, around the Jade Sea, to the distant and fabled lands
of Asshai and the Shadow. Essos climate is temperate in the northern and
western portions, and subtropical in the southern & eastern portions. Rainfall
generally decreases as one moves eastward in Essos.

The extreme eastern end of the continent has not been fully mapped. Westeros's
landmass is much longer from north to south, extending from the deserts of
Dorne to the polar regions north of the Wall, but east-to-west travel is much
shorter. In contrast, the greater bulk of Essos runs along an east-west
latitude, while its northern and southern extremes are a shorter distance. On
the western shore of Essos, the furthest point north at Braavos is at the same
latitude as the Vale of Arryn, and the furthest point south near Tyrosh is at
the same latitude as Dorne, separated only by the island chain known as the
Stepstones. Pentos, located roughly between these two extremes, is at the same
latitude as King's Landing.

Westeros is a continent located in the far west of the known world. It is
separated from the continent of Essos by a strip of water known as the Narrow
Sea. Most of the action in Game of Thrones takes place in Westeros.

Westeros is a continent located in the far west of the known world. It is
separated from the continent of Essos by a strip of water known as the Narrow
Sea. Most of the action in Game of Thrones takes place in Westeros.

Author of the series George R.R. Martin has stated that the continent of
Westeros is roughly the same size as the real-life continent of South America.

Almost the entire continent, barring only the lands in the furthest north
beyond the Wall, is ruled by a single political entity known as the Seven
Kingdoms, which holds fealty to the King of the Andals and the First Men, who
sits on the Iron Throne in the city of King's Landing. The terms "Seven
Kingdoms" and "Westeros" are normally used interchangeably.

People or things from Westeros are referred to as "Westerosi".

You want me to serve the woman who murdered my King,
who butchered my men, who crippled my son?

I want you to serve the realm!
Tell the Queen you will confes your vile treason,
tell your son to lay down his sword and
proclaim Joffrey as the true heir.

You think my life is some precious thing to me?
That I would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what?

You grew up with actors.
You learned their craft and you learned it well.

But I grew up with soldiers, I learned how to die a long time ago.
