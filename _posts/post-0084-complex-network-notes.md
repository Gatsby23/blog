Complex Network Notes
=====================

### Scale-free Network

A scale-free network is a network whose degree distribution follows a power law,
at least asymptotically. That is, the fraction $P(k)$ of nodes in the
network having $k$ connections to other nodes goes for large values of $k$ as

$$
    P(k) \ \sim \ k^\boldsymbol{-\gamma}
$$

where $\gamma$ is a parameter whose value is typically in the range 2 <
$\gamma$ < 3, although occasionally it may lie outside these bounds.

    larger hubs are highlighted.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Scale-free_network_sample.png/600px-Scale-free_network_sample.png)
