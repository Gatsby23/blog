LeetCode OJ is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. Pick from
an expanding library of more than 190 questions, code and submit your solution
to see if you have solved it correctly. It is that easy!

Our platform currently supports a total of 9 languages: C, C++, Java, Python,
C#, JavaScript, Ruby, Bash, MySQL.

* [Frequently Asked Questions - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/details/frequently-asked-questions)
</div>

<div id="p60line34">
The historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a
'test set'.  For the training set, we provide the outcome ( 'ground truth' )
for each passenger.  You will use this set to build your model to generate
predictions for the test set.

For each passenger in the test set, you must predict whether or not they
survived the sinking ( 0 for deceased, 1 for survived ).  Your score is the
percentage of passengers you correctly predict.

The Kaggle leaderboard has a public and private component.  50% of your
predictions for the test set have been randomly assigned to the public
leaderboard ( the same 50% for all users ).  Your score on this public portion
is what will appear on the leaderboard.  At the end of the contest, we will
reveal your score on the private 50% of the data, which will determine the
final winner.  This method prevents users from 'overfitting' to the
leaderboard.

<div id="p31line42">
* One account per participant: no private sharing outside teams
* Privately sharing code or data outside of teams is not permitted. It's okay to share code if made available to all participants on the forums.
* Team Mergers: yeah, we can merge teams
* Team Limits: nil
* Submission Limits@ 10 entries/day, up to 5 final sumbissions for judging
* Competition Timeline: start -- merger/submission deadline, end date
* This is a fun competition aimed at helping you get started with machine learning.
  While the Titanic dataset is publically available on the internet, looking up
  the answers defeats the entire purpose.  So seriously, don't do that.
* Rules Acceptance: I accepted these rules at 7:06 am, Monday 7 March 2016 UTC.
