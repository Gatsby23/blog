INTP
====

INTP:

  - Dominant introverted thinking
  - Auxiliary extraverted intuition
  - Tertiary introverted sensing
  - Inferior extraverted feeling

Cognitive learning styles

:   The test is scored by evaluating each answer in terms of what it reveals
    about the taker. Each question is relevant to one of the following
    cognitive learning styles. Each is not a polar opposite, but a gradual
    continuum.

    Extraversion/Introversion

    :   The extraverted types learn best by talking and interacting with
        others. By interacting with the physical world, extraverts can process
        and make sense of new information. The introverted types **prefer quiet
        reflection and privacy**. Information processing occurs for introverts as
        they explore ideas and concepts internally.

    Sensing/Intuition

    :   The second continuum reflects what a person focuses their attentions
        on. Sensing types enjoy a learning environment in which the material is
        presented in a detailed and sequential manner. Sensing types often
        attend to what is occurring in the present, and can move to the
        abstract after they have established a concrete experience. Intuitive
        types **prefer a learning atmosphere in which an emphasis is placed on
        meaning and associations. Insight is valued higher than careful
        observation, and pattern recognition occurs naturally for Intuitive
        types.**

    Thinking/Feeling

    :   The third continuum (`[kən'tɪnjʊəm]`, n. 连续统一体；闭联集) reflects a
        person’s decision preferences. **Thinking types desire objective truth
        and logical principles and are natural at deductive reasoning.** Feeling
        types place an emphasis on issues and causes that can be personalized
        while they consider other people's motives.

    Judging/Perceiving

    :   The fourth continuum reflects how a person regards complexity. Judging
        types will thrive when information is organized and structured, and
        they will be motivated to complete assignments in order to gain
        closure. **Perceiving types will flourish in a flexible learning
        environment in which they are stimulated by new and exciting ideas.**
        Judging types like to be on time, while perceiving types may be late
        and/or procrastinate (延迟).

INTPs are marked by a **quiet**, **stoic** (`['stəʊɪk]`, 斯多葛学派哲学家；禁欲主义者),
**modest**, and **aloof** (冷淡的；远离的；冷漠的) exterior that masks
strong creativity and enthusiasm for novel possibilities. （这句话是说 INTP 看上去十分冷淡，这
掩盖了我们十足的创造力和对新奇事务的好奇心）Their weaknesses
include poor organization, insensitivity to social niceties (美好；细节；拘泥细节), and a tendency to
get lost in abstractions. Keirsey referred to INTPs as Architects, one of the
four types belonging to the temperament he called the Rationals. INTPs are
**relatively rare**, accounting for 1–5% of the U.S. population.

The PersonalityPage Type Portraits

:   There are sixteen distinct personality types in the currently most
    widely-accepted Personality Type model. Each type has its own characteristics
    which can be identified in individual personalities. We have created a profile
    of each personality type, which provides a guideline for understanding the
    similarities and differences amongst the types.

      - ISTJ - The Duty Fulfillers
      - ESTJ - The Guardians
      - ISFJ - The Nurturers
      - ESFJ - The Caregivers
      - ISTP - The Mechanics
      - ESTP - The Doers
      - ESFP - The Performers
      - ISFP - The Artists
      - ENTJ - The Executives

    **Portrait of an INTP - Introverted iNtuitive Thinking Perceiving**

    :   |      (Introverted Thinking with Extraverted Intuition)
        |                             The Thinker

        As an INTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you
        **deal with things rationally and logically**. Your secondary mode is external,
        where you take things in primarily via your intuition.

        INTPs **live in the world of theoretical possibilities**. They see everything
        in terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. They
        live primarily inside their own minds, having the ability to analyze
        difficult problems, identify patterns, and come up with logical
        explanations. They **seek clarity in everything**, and are therefore driven to
        build knowledge. They are the "**absent-minded professors**", who highly value
        intelligence and the ability to apply logic to theories to find solutions.
        They typically are so strongly driven to turn problems into logical
        explanations, that they live much of their lives within their own heads,
        and may **not place as much importance or value on the external world**. Their
        natural drive to turn theories into concrete understanding may turn into a
        feeling of personal responsibility to solve theoretical problems, and
        **help society move towards a higher understanding**.

        INTPs **value knowledge above all else**. Their minds are constantly working to
        generate new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories. They
        approach problems and theories with **enthusiasm and skepticism**, ignoring
        existing rules and opinions and defining their own approach to the
        resolution. They seek patterns and logical explanations for anything that
        interests them. They're **usually extremely bright**, and able to be
        objectively critical in their analysis. They love new ideas, and become
        very excited over abstractions and theories. They love to discuss these
        concepts with others. They may **seem "dreamy" and distant to others**, because
        they spend a lot of time inside their minds **musing (沉思的；瞑想的) over
        theories**. They hate to work on routine things - they would much prefer to
        build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation of the
        system to others. They are intensely interested in theory, and will put
        forth tremendous amounts of time and energy into finding a solution to a
        problem with has piqued their interest.

        INTPs **do not like to lead or control people**. They're very tolerant and
        flexible in most situations, unless one of their firmly held beliefs has
        been violated or challenged, in which case they may take a very rigid
        stance. The INTP is likely to be very shy when it comes to meeting new
        people. On the other hand, the INTP is very **self-confident and gregarious**
        (`[grɪ'geərɪəs]` adj. 社交的；群居的) around people they know well, or when
        discussing theories which they fully understand.

        The INTP has no understanding or value for decisions made on the basis of
        personal subjectivity or feelings. They strive constantly to achieve
        logical conclusions to problems, and don't understand the importance or
        relevance of applying subjective emotional considerations to decisions. For
        this reason, **INTPs are usually not in-tune with how people are feeling**, and
        are not naturally well-equiped to meet the emotional needs of others.

        The INTP may have a problem with **self-aggrandizement** (`[,selfə'ɡrændizmənt]`, n. 自我扩张)
        and **social rebellion**, which will interfere with their creative
        potential. Since their Feeling side is their least developed trait, the
        INTP may **have difficulty giving the warmth and support that is sometimes
        necessary in intimate relationships**. If the INTP doesn't realize the value
        of attending to other people's feelings, he or she may become overly
        critical and sarcastic with others. **If the INTP is not able to find a place
        for themself which supports the use of their strongest abilities, they may
        become generally negative and cynical.** If the INTP has not developed their
        Sensing side sufficiently, they may become unaware of their environment,
        and exhibit weakness in performing maintenance-type tasks, such as
        bill-paying and dressing appropriately.

        For the INTP, it is extremely important that ideas and facts are expressed
        correctly and succinctly (`[sək'siŋktli]`, 简洁地). They are likely to
        express themselves in what they believe to be **absolute truths**. Sometimes,
        their well thought-out understanding of an idea is not easily
        understandable by others, but the INTP is **not naturally likely to tailor
        the truth so as to explain it in an understandable way to others**. The INTP
        may be prone to abandoning a project once they have figured it out, moving
        on to the next thing. It's important that the INTP place importance on
        expressing their developed theories in understandable ways. In the end, an
        amazing discovery means nothing if you are the only person who understands
        it.

        The INTP is usually very **independent, unconventional, and original**. They
        are not likely to place much value on traditional goals such as popularity
        and security. They usually have complex characters, and may tend to be
        **restless and temperamental** (`[,temp(ə)rə'ment(ə)l]`, adj. 喜怒无常的；性情的).
        They are strongly ingenious (有独创性的；机灵的), and have unconventional
        thought patterns which allows them to analyze ideas in new ways.
        **Consequently, a lot of scientific breakthroughs in the world have been made
        by the INTP.**

        **The INTP is at his best when he can work on his theories independently.**
        When given an environment which supports his creative genius and possible
        eccentricity (`[,eksen'trɪsɪtɪ]`, n. 古怪；怪癖；离心率) , the INTP can
        accomplish truly remarkable things.

        **These are the pioneers of new thoughts in our society.**

    INTP Relationships

    :   INTPs live rich worlds inside their minds, which are full of imagination
        and excitement. Consequently, they sometimes find the external world
        **pales** in comparison. This may result in a **lack of motivation to form
        and maintain relationships**.  INTPs are not likely to have a very large
        circle of significant relationships in their lives. They're much more
        likely to have a few very close relationships, which they hold in **great
        esteem and with great affection*8. Since the INTP's primary focus and
        attention is turned inwards, aimed towards seeking clarity from abstract
        ideas, they are not naturally tuned into others' emotional feelings and
        needs. They tend to be difficult to get to know well, and hold back parts
        of themselves until the other person has proven themselves "worthy" of
        hearing the INTP's thoughts.  Holding Knowledge and Brain Power above all
        else in importance, the INTP will choose to be around people who they
        consider to be intelligent. **Once the INTP has committed themself to a
        relationship, they tend to be very faithful and loyal, and form
        affectionate attachments which are pure and straight-forward.** The INTP has
        no interest or understanding of game-playing with regards to relationships.
        However, if something happens which the INTP considers **irreconcilable**
        (`[ɪ'rɛkənsaɪləbl]` adj. 不能和解的), they will leave the relationship and
        not look back.

        INTP Strengths

        -   They feel love and affection for those close to them which is
            almost childlike in its purity
        -   Generally laid-back (懒散的) and easy-going, willing to defer (服从)
            to their mates
        -   Approach things which interest them very enthusiastically
        -   **Richly imaginative and creative**
        -   **Do not feel personally threatened by conflict or criticism**
        -   Usually are not demanding, with **simple daily needs**

        INTP Weaknesses

        -   Not naturally in tune with others' feelings; **slow to respond to emotional needs**
        -   Not naturally good at expressing their own feelings and emotions
        -   Tend to be **suspicious and distrusting of others**
        -   Not usually good at practical matters, such as money management, unless
            their work involves these concerns
        -   They have difficulty leaving bad relationships
        -   Tend to "blow off" conflict situations by ignoring them, or else they
            "blow up" in heated anger

        INTPs as Lovers

        :   > To love means to open ourselves to the negative as well as the
            > positive - to grief, sorrow, and disappointment as well as to joy,
            > fulfillment, and an intensity of consciousness we did not know was possible
            > before.
            >
            > |                                                     -- Rollo May

            INTPs approach their intimate relationships quite **seriously** - as they
            approach most things in life. They **take their vows and commitments
            seriously**, and are usually faithful and loyal. They are usually pretty
            easy to live with and be around, because they have simple daily needs
            and are not overly demanding of their partners in almost any respect.
            While the INTP's internal life is highly theoretical and complex, their
            external life in comparison is usually quite simple. They like to keep
            the complexities of their external world to a minimum, so that they can
            focus their brain power on working through their theories internally.
            This makes them very straight-forward, honest lovers, with a love that
            is quite pure in its simple, uncomplicated nature.

            Although they choose to keep things straight-forward in their
            relationships, this does not mean that the INTP is lacking in depth of
            feeling or passion. **The INTP is very creative person, who has vivid
            imaginations. They can be very excitable and passionate about their
            love relationships.** Sometimes, they have a problem reconciling the
            exciting visions of their internal worlds with the actuality of their
            external circumstances.

            Sexually, the INTP usually approaches intimacy with enthusiasm and
            excitement. Some INTPs play down entirely the need for sexual relations
            in their lives, but most use their rich imaginations and child-like
            enthusiasm to make the most of the moment. The INTP will usually be
            experiencing the moment with vivid intensity inside their own minds,
            although this may or may not be apparent to their partner.

            The largest area of potential strife (冲突；争吵；不和) in an INTP's
            intimate relationship is their slowness in understanding and meeting
            their partner's emotional needs. The INTP may be extremely dedicated to
            the relationship, and deeply in love with their partner, but may have
            **no understanding of their mate's emotional life**, and may
            **not express their own feelings often or well**. When the INTP does express
            themselves, it's likely to be in their own way at their own time,
            rather than in response to their partner's needs. If this is an issue
            which has caused serious problems in a relationship, the INTP should
            work on becoming more aware of their partner's feelings, and their
            partner should work on not requiring explicit positive affirmation to
            feel loved by the INTP.

            INTPs do **not like to deal with messy complications**, such as
            interpersonal conflict, and so they may fall into the habit of ignoring
            conflict when it occurs. If they feel they must face the conflict,
            they're likely to **approach it from an analytical perspective**. This may
            aggravate the conflict situation, if their partner simply wants to feel
            that they are supported and loved. Most people (and especially those
            with the Feeling preference) simply want to be encouraged, affirmed and
            supported when they are upset. The INTP should practice meeting these
            needs in conflict situations.

            **Although two well-developed individuals of any type can enjoy a healthy
            relationship, the INTP's natural partner is the ENTJ, or the ESTJ.** The
            INTP's dominant function of Introverted Thinking is best matched with a
            partner whose personality is dominated by Extraverted Thinking. The
            INTP/ENTJ match is ideal, because these types shared Intuition as a
            common way of perceiving the world, but INTP/ESTJ is also a good match.
            How did we arrive at this?

        INTPs as Parents

        :   > You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth...
            > Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness;
            > For even as He loves the arrow that flies,
            > so He loves also the bow that is stable.
            >
            > |                                                -- Kahlil Gibran

            INTPs love and respect Knowledge, and want to **pass their jewels of
            thought down to their children**. Their greatest goal and satisfaction as
            a parent is **seeing their children grow into independent, rational adults**.

            INTP parents are likely to encourage their children to grow as
            individuals, rather than attempt to fit them into a **preconceived mold**.
            They will stress autonomy through the children's growth. They're likely
            to respect their children's opinions and wishes, and allow their
            children to have a voice and presence in the family.

            The INTP parents are likely to be pretty laid-back and flexible with
            their children, sometimes to the point of being relatively "hands-off"
            with regards to the day-to-day issues. They're likely to count on their
            spouse for providing structure and schedules. Since the INTP themself
            does not live in an overly structured or organized manner, they're not
            likely to expect or create this environment for their children. If
            their spouse is not someone with the "J" preference, their children may
            suffer from a lack of boundaries. This is something the INTP should pay
            special attention to. Growing children don't know Right from Wrong, and
            so benefit from having their parents define these boundaries for them.

            In spite of their relatively unstructured approach to parenting, INTPs
            take their role as parent very seriously, and are likely to put forth
            much effort into doing what they feel will be most effective in helping
            their children grow into independent, wise adults. INTPs enjoy
            parenting, and get a lot of fun out of their children. They're also
            likely to be very proud and loyal parents.

            **INTPs may have a problem meeting the emotional needs of their children.**
            Although they generally are **deeply caring and supportive individuals**,
            the INTP does **not always pick up on emotional clues**. A troubled child
            of an unaware INTP parent may have to result to drastic
            "attention-getting" tactics to get their parent to understand their
            emotional difficulties. If you find yourself in this situation, you may
            find that expressing some of your own emotions will do wonders for your
            child, yourself, and your relationship. Although it may not be possible
            for you to suddenly be "tuned in" on what your children are feeling, at
            least you can let them know that you care.

            Children of INTP parents generally remember them respectfully and
            affectionately as loyal, fair, and tolerant parents, who care for them
            a great deal, although they don't often show it.

        INTPs as Friends

        :   INTPs are likely to have friends **who share their interests and pursuits**.
            Since the INTP loves theories, ideas, and concepts, they are
            not likely to have much patience or understanding for people with the
            Sensing preference, who are not usually comfortable with abstract
            conceptualizing.

[INTP怎样看待爱情？ - 知乎](https://www.zhihu.com/question/30652928)

:   我作为一只没谈过恋爱的 intp 妹纸，表示周围的人百分之九十以上都提不起兴趣或者
    提起兴趣以后注意力一分散就忘了。。。。楼上的说的很好，有很多时候我就觉得如
    果人是被生理需求驱动去谈恋爱的话还不如自己撸，谈恋爱比这个花的功夫多太多了
    。简而言之，我总感觉虽然理论上 intp 的感情应该是最好搞定的，但实际上却是最没
    兴趣的。。。再简而言之引用我一个好朋友（她也是 intp, 我感觉如果我们能在未来
    有交集点的话估计就在一起了嘿嘿）的话：“我去我自己和自己还没玩够呢，谁有时间
    理你啊。”

    对伴侣要求太高，要比自己有趣要比自己聪明要比自己有见识

    ---

    INTP 机械社交能力爆棚，只要他想，没有他处不上的朋友，**warmest machine** 的称号
    不是盖的好吗。他们没有固定偏好，选长得美的、能力强的、有才华的、性格好的、人品
    高的不同朋友交往后，你猜他最后会留下谁？当然是可以带给他们进步的贵人们。。**就是
    那么功利。**

    总感觉会有部分 INTPers 看见题目后不解地思考：我为什么需要朋友？INTP 的社交焦虑只会
    来源于**想方设法和围绕身边的那么多奇奇怪怪的人温和地拉开距离**；而不会是纠结如何多
    交一个朋友……重度 INTP 维持社交状态只是想营造一种自己不是怪胎的假象，自我保护而已
    。INTP 不对任何人有偏见，他们公平地排斥着所有类型的人类= =。INTP 与谁都能自如地聊
    天玩耍。同时不能、不想、不愿意与大多数人，真实地！深交。

    （他们每天的 OS：好烦，好尴尬，要奔溃了，想一个人静静，想绝交……妈的再忍一忍，老
    子也放不下这段关系的淹没成本和机会成本）

    他们把一天安排得满满当当和朋友们出去 high 完后，心里会想：完成社交任务，但一天
    就这样废了！**信息过载**，好折寿，nmb！

    如何逼死 INTP：只要让他们和别人在一起，完全没有私人空间，不出三天，准奔溃，轻则
    发飙甩脸子，重则做出大逆不道危害社会的事。

    ---

    他们无比能够正视“朋友圈是随着时间流动而改变的”，他们表达友爱的方式是：“我希望这
    段我们能够亲密无间的日子结束得慢一点” 而不是“我们要做一辈子朋友”

    你认真诚恳，斟字酌句地说出内心的想法和看法，而得到的回应只是

    “什么意思？”

    warmest social machine，给别人以让对方想和你深交的热情和温暖，三天不见后你却忘
    了对方的脸。

    ---

    **精于识别他人的反社会情节；因为 intp 自己也有**

    厌烦于：**“善意的谎言，敷衍的赞同，谄媚的赞美…”**
